Cool city.
Team Dark! Let's slag these robots!
Yeah... Well, I'm not here to save you!
Hey, you all right? Hold it together!
Goodbye forever... Shadow the Hedgehog.
Why did Gerald give me a soul?!
Only ONE Chaos Emerald left!
That's more than enough for the demonstration. So let's get this show on the road!
Then why don't you destroy it now? You must destroy it before it collects all the Chaos Emeralds and uses its true power!
It's been awhile... Let me make sure you haven't gone soft, Sonic. 
I'm in position, doctor. Tell me when.
